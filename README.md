## Summary

### Introduction
KJ Marketing aims to enhance customer engagement by targeting high-end customers. This report details the methods used to segment the customer base and develop targeted marketing strategies.

### Data Preparation and Cleaning
1. **Handling Missing Values:** Converted string values to numeric and replaced null values with the column median.
2. **Handling Duplicates:** Identified and resolved duplicates in the `customer_id` column by either averaging values or dropping rows with negative values.
3. **Handling Outliers:** Used the IQR method and Winsorizing to manage outliers in the data.

### Feature Scaling and Standardization
Used `StandardScaler` to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process by standardizing features to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

### Clustering Analysis
- **Methodology:** Employed the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters, choosing 5 clusters based on business requirements.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Selected K-Means for its simplicity and efficiency.
- **Challenges:** Addressed the discrepancy between the Elbow Method's recommendation and business requirements for the number of clusters.

### Business Segmentation
Identified five customer segments:
1. **High-End Premium:** High spenders with frequent visits and large basket sizes. Focus on exclusive benefits and personalized services.
2. **High-End Loyal:** Customers with high basket sizes and moderate spending/visits. Encourage frequent visits and cater to bulk purchasing.
3. **High-End Frequent:** Frequent visitors with moderate spending and smaller basket sizes. Promote complementary products and volume discounts.
4. **Medium Level:** Moderate spenders with average visit frequency and basket sizes. Use tailored promotions and marketing campaigns.
5. **Low Level:** Least engaged customers with the lowest spending, visit frequency, and basket sizes. Re-engage with significant discounts and introductory offers.

### Rule-Based Segmentation
Defined rule-based conditions to differentiate customer segments based on spending, visit frequency, and basket size.

### Marketing Intervention Strategies
Developed targeted marketing strategies for each segment, focusing on loyalty programs, personalized offerings, frequency-based rewards, cross-selling opportunities, educational content, and re-engagement campaigns.

### Conclusion
The segmentation and targeted marketing strategies provide a roadmap for KJ Marketing to enhance customer engagement and optimize marketing efforts, driving business growth and maintaining a competitive edge in the retail market.
